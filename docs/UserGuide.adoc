Thank you for your interest in the *NUS Module Planner* and welcome to the *User Guide*!

== Introduction

The *NUS Module Planner* (_NUSModPlnr_) is for Computer Science (CS) students at the National University of Singapore (NUS) to manage their enrollments in NUS modules over their school life. **With NUSModPlnr, module planning has never been easier!**

When starting up the application, you will be able to see the *Home Screen* (_Figure 1. below_).

Do you want to keep track of the modules you will be taking over multiple semesters? Do you want to easily create multiple plans of these multiple semesters?

Are you frustrated about managing the numerous details of the graduation requirements for a CS degree? NUSModPlnr allows you to check which graduation requirements you can satisfy, on the fly.

Do you want to keep track of your grades to better decide on which modules to enrol in? NUSModPlnr provides a simple way to calculate grade statistics.

If you can type fast, NUSModPlnr can help you plan your modules in a fast, yet intuitive way. NUSModPlnr is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== How To Use This User Guide

NUSModPlnr is a timetable and enrollment management application, which help you add plans which consist of your degree programme and timetables for different semesters.
