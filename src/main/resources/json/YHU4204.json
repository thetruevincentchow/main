{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Why did Europe rise and China fall? Why did Europe achieve long‐term sustained economic growth (the industrial revolution) in the eighteenth century, while China ‐ perhaps the world’s most politically and technologically advanced empire at the time ‐ declined dramatically? Why was Japan the only empire in Asia to catch up with Europe in the nineteenth century? We will attempt to answer these questions by examining the histories of Britain, Europe, China, India and Japan and by reading the major debates in economic history and sociology on the ‘rise of the west’ and the ‘great divergence.’","title":"Rise of the West and the Great Divergence","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,8,1.5],"prerequisite":"This course is in principle open only to senior‐level students.
