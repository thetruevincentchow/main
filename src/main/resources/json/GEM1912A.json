{"acadYear":"2019/2020","preclusion":"GEM1902% or GEM1912% or UTC11%","description":"The late Steve Jobs, former CEO of the Apple company, has been credited with ‘humanising technology’: recognising that technology design needs to be sensitive to human characteristics. In this Junior Seminar, students will be exploring various ways of thinking about the relationship between the ‘technical’ and the ‘human’. What can these tell us about the organization of social life, and how (if at all) do they contribute to the design of ‘better’ technologies? A central role will be reserved for ethnographic studies of technology‐in‐use – an\nacademic approach that has gained traction with industry over the past decades. Students will also acquire hands‐on experience of this approach by\nstudying technology‐in‐use among friends, in the home, in the College/University, or workplace.","title":"Jr Sem Special Topics: Humanising Technology","department":"Tembusu College","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEM1912A","semesterData":[]}
