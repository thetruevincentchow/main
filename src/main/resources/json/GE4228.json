{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"This module explores the co‐constitutive relationship between gender and the city. Drawing from theoretical arguments made by geographers on feminist interventions into the urban, the module provides a gendered re‐orientation of critical issues for the city such as transport, housing, uneven development, regeneration and social exclusion. Students will draw from their understanding of key spatial concepts covered in GE3206 Gender, Space and Place to further develop their understanding of the socio‐spatial dialectic and the politics that underpin the social (re)production of built environments and their impact on gendered representations and (re)distribution in cities.","title":"Gender and the City","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,3.5,6],"prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GE with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\nGE3206.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"GE4228","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"AS2-0302","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":50}]}]}
