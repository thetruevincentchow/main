{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"Discrete optimization is the study of problems where the\ngoal is to find an optimal arrangement from among a finite\nset of possible arrangements. Discrete problems are also\ncalled combinatorial optimization problems. Many\napplications in business, industry, and computer science\nlead to such problems, and we will touch on the theory\nbehind these applications.\nThe course takes a modern view of discrete optimization\nand covers the main areas of application and the main\noptimization algorithms. It covers the following topics\n(tentative):\n• integer and combinatorial optimization: introduction and\nbasic definitions\n• alternative formulations\n• optimality, relaxation and bounds\n• Graph Theory and Network Flow\n• integral polyhedral, including matching problems, matroid\nand the Matroid Greedy algorithm\n• polyhedral approaches: theory of valid inequalities,\ncutting-plane algorithms\nThe course also discusses how these approaches can be\nused to tackle problems arising in modern service system,\nincluding static and dynamic matching markets, ad words\nallocation, pricing and assortment optimization etc.","title":"Discrete Optimization and Algorithms","department":"Analytics and Operations","faculty":"NUS Business School","workload":[3,0,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"BDC6111/IE6001 Foundations of Optimization","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"BDC6302","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["BDC6111","IE6001"]}}
