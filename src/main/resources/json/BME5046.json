This course is designed to help you meet this challenge. The course will achieve this objective in three ways. First, it will provide you with a framework for increasing individual, group and organisational performance. Second, it will help you understand and acquire critical leadership knowledge and skills required to shape and manage the behavior of people in organisations.
