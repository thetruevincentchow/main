{"acadYear":"2019/2020","description":"The aim of this course is to examine animal behavior from a biological, and especially an evolutionary, point of view. We will explore the causes and consequences of animal behaviors, including topics such as: optimality and foraging; predation and risk; territoriality and aggression; mating competition; parent-offspring and sibling conflict; personality and behavioural syndromes; living in groups; altruism, mutualism, and eusociality. We will also address some questions of the evolution of cognition in animals. Students will discuss the primary literature, conduct small group and independent projects on animals, and write individual review papers.","title":"Animal Behaviour","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,3,2,4.5],"prerequisite":"Class of 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020: YCC1122 Quantitative Reasoning and YCC1131 Scientific Inquiry and YSC2231 Foundations of Neuroscience (or previously YSC2211 Neurobiology & Behaviour) or YSC2216 Evolutionary Biology or YSS2201 Understanding Behaviour and Cognition or permission of the instructor.\n\nClass of 2021 onwards:\nScientific Inquiry 1 (new) and YCC1122 Quantitative Reasoning and YSC2231 Foundations of Neuroscience (or previously YSC2211 Neurobiology & Behaviour) or YSC2216 Evolutionary Biology or YSS2201 Understanding Behaviour and Cognition or permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSC3235","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"and":["YCC1122","YCC1131","YSC2231"]},"fulfillRequirements":["YSC2240"]}
